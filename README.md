# Stark-Suit-Repair
This project tests basic aspects of Rust, such as using mutability in variable declarations, looping constructs, and more. The next file has code that emulates a locator much like the one on the suit of Iron Man (fictional character from Marvel Comics). This file has functions that implement a Priority Queue data structure, and a function that calculates orthogonal distance given two tuples. Another function in this file determines what enemy Stark should fight in a supposed battle. He should fight the closest enemy that someone on his team is not closer to than him. The last file uses these basic features of Rust to emulate a sort of an intelligent paradigm similar to Jarvis which is used by Iron Man. One function return commands as strings, and the other function returns a Command type given a valid string.
